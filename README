I created a user with some notes already uploaded with images in different locations (incase you don't wan't to go to different locations yourself :) ) 
email: example@example.com
password: 123456

On the opening screen a User can attempt to log in with an email and password or just by email through google.
The same applies to a new user registering (registering by google opens an option to chose emails saved on the device).


I used a recycler view on the main screen for the list of notes.
Once the user writes a note, a fragment container can change between map mode and list mode.

when editing a note, the old date was kept unless the user manually changed it. The location was kept unless the user marked the checkbox (invisible in the case of a new note)

The app requests permission to location to add locations to notes and when the user tries to upload a picture it also requires permission.

I implemented the bonus of adding images. If the internet connection isn't good it can take time to upload and download images (doesnt
cause bugs because the save button isn't pressable while uploading.).
